Project Ruby Advanced Building Blocks 

Project 1: Bubble Sort
  
    Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 
    It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?).
  
  
    Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block.
    The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. 

Project 2: Enumerable Methods

    You learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed in to the Array and Hash classes (among others) 
    and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods.
    To prove that there's no magic to it, you're going to rebuild those methods.
